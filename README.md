# Projects
This repo will serve as a portfolio like structure for the tasks I have undertaken / projects I have done.

:car::blue_car::red_car: [Sahibinden](https://github.com/berkkarahan/sahib-pred)
-
This was my first pet project. In a nutshell;

- This is a regression problem using real world data where I tried to use car properties such as kilometers, mark, model, color, engine etc to predict its price.

:car: :arrow_forward: :computer: [Sahibinden Scraper](https://github.com/berkkarahan/sahibinden-scrape)
-
I wanted to be able to gather the data required for car price modeling. So I wrote the scraper myself. It is;

-	Fast enough to be fast and not hit site limit(using random delays between each subsequent request).
-	Threaded.

:hotel::sunrise::ocean: [Trivago Predictive hits](https://github.com/berkkarahan/trivago-challenge)
-
This was a [job application challenge]([https://jobs.zealpath.com/m/case/detail/298](https://jobs.zealpath.com/m/case/detail/298)). Although my project files are messy I have tried to demonstrate some feature engineering and feature interaction using autoencoders. 

:chart_with_upwards_trend::chart_with_downwards_trend: [Forecasting Challenge](https://github.com/berkkarahan/forecasting-case-study)
-
A forecasting challenge demonstrating a timeseries application with traditional ML algorithms using both IoT data and time features as categoricals.

:bicyclist::snake: [Traveling Salesman with Python](https://github.com/berkkarahan/shortestpath)
-
Traveling salesman with Python using both scipy's built in solver and the Dijkstra's shortest path.
